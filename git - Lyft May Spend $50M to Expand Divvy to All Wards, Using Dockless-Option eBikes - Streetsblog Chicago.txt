Out of the blue, the Divvy bike system may be expanding citywide. The
city of Chicago is expected to announce tomorrow that the existing Divvy
contract will be amended to make Lyft, the parent company of Divvy
concessionaire Motivate, the sponsor of the network, replacing current
sponsor Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois. As part of the deal, which
will require City Council approval, Lyft would spend $50 million on
stations and bikes to bring the bike-share service to neighborhoods that
currently lack docks. The city says it would also receive at least $77
million in sponsorship money from Lyft over nine years.

The deal could be good news for making the system more equitable. There
are currently a higher density of stations downtown and in more affluent
neighborhoods, and many outlying communities don't have docks at all.

The most obvious downside of the the deal is that, with Lyft replacing
Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois as the sponsor, the bikes will now
bear the logo of a ride-share service. Studies have shown that ride-
share is increasing traffic deaths <https://
usa.streetsblog.org/2018/10/24/study-uber-and-lyft-are-increasing-
traffic-deaths/> and congestion <https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2018/07/25/
uber-and-lyft-are-overwhelming-urban-streets-and-cities-need-to-act-
fast/> in cities, and decreasing <https://
usa.streetsblog.org/2017/10/13/uber-and-lyft-are-cannibalizing-transit-
in-major-american-cities/> transit ridership, so it's somewhat
problematic that the thousands of Divvy bikes will double as ads for
Lyft. In addition, the amendment would freeze out any other bike-share
providers from operating on Chicago streets -- more on that later.

“My administration has made it a priority to create a variety of high-
quality, reliable transportation options to get Chicagoans and visitors
where they want to go,” Mayor Rahm Emanuel said in a statement. “While
the Divvy program has expanded substantially since its launch in 2013
and helped make Chicago the best bike city in America <https://
chi.streetsblog.org/2016/09/19/bicycling-gives-chicago-the-award-for-
best-biking-city-do-we-deserve-it/>, City Council has the opportunity to
create a modernized system that creates increasing annual revenues for
the city while ensuring all 50 wards have access to bike sharing.”

Under the proposed amendment, Lyft would expand the system to all 50
wards by 2021, adding 10,500 bikes and 175 stations. That would bring
the total to about 16,500 bikes and 800 stations. All of the new Chicago
bikes would be electric pedal-assist cycles and have hybrid locking
capabilities, so they can be locked at a station or to a regular bike rack.

The city says the growth of the system would create more than 200
additional jobs with Divvy in Chicago. Lyft would also offer a job-
training program for youth and ex-offenders; expand the Divvy for
Everyone <https://chi.streetsblog.org/2018/01/15/regular-divvy-
membership-is-still-heavily-white-but-divvy-for-everyone-is-diverse/>
program for low-income Chicagoans; and pilot an adaptive bike-sharing
program <https://chi.streetsblog.org/2017/05/24/advocates-divvy-should-
be-expanded-to-include-bikes-for-people-with-disabilities/> for people
with disabilities.

Under the agreement, the city says, Chicago would maintain ownership of
the current hardware. Lyft  would continue to operate Divvy with
equipment owned by the city as well as new equipment purchased by Lyft. 
The city would maintain control over "significant" fare pricing changes
and any new fare products or promotions, and Lyft would continue to be
accountable for meeting service quality standards.

The amendment would not extend the existing term of the Divvy contract,
which has nine years remaining. Any extension beyond the contract’s
remaining nine years would also require City Council approval. If the
agreement is approved by the Council, Lyft would have exclusive rights
to operate bike-share from the city’s public right of way, and the city
would not license or permit any other bike-share operations during the
term of the agreement.

Additionally, the city asserts, the amendment would restructure the
financial terms of the contract to "dramatically" increase annual
guaranteed revenues and reduce financial risk to the city. Lyft would
pay the city an annual payment of $6 million, which would increase by
four percent each year. In addition, the city would receive $1.5 million
in minimum guaranteed revenue from advertising and promotions, and five
percent of all rider revenue that exceeds $20 million per year. The city
says that over the nine-year life of the contract, this would total a
minimum of $77 million in guaranteed revenue.

The city asserts that the proposed agreement would also eliminate the
city’s current financial risk for the system, since Lyft will absorb all
operational, cost, and revenue risk of Divvy’s performance, and would
eliminate the city’s current obligation to share in operating losses
<https://chi.streetsblog.org/2018/12/04/after-a-2016-slump-2017-was-
divvys-most-profitable-year-ever/>.

The city says it would continue to maintain oversight of the performance
of the Divvy contract through a set of ridership and equity targets, and
the city would retain its ability to assess financial penalties if Lyft
does not meet these targets.

While, on the face of it, the upcoming announcement seems to be great
news for Chicago, the devil's in the details. Hopefully aldermen will
give this amendment much more scrutiny than they did to Chicago's much-
hated parking meter deal <https://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/
features-cover-april-9-2009/Content?oid=1098561>, which was approved
within a matter of days after a heavy push by then-mayor Richard M. Daley.

*Update 3/13/19: *Per a city official, the new contract would not
prevent dockless scooter companies from operating in Chicago.
